# DSA Learning

I use this repository to learn how data structures and algorithms in relation to their execution. This will drive me towards full appreciation of DSA and figure out how to use this in applications.

For the last few days: I have learnt how to work with hash tables (with the linked list solution and the linear probing solution), arrays, linked_lists (both doubly and single lists), queues and stacks.

I will be revising further right after finishing binary trees. Oops, I just did ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Anyway I wonder if you can actually read code that you wrote. i remember reading maths ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤¯.
